## building it

there are are 2 important switches for the script.  

`-m look` - this is `look` mode, and will look for images in the `images/look` folder.  

`-p chatgpt` 
this controls the prediction path.

### `chatgpt`  
- uses chatgpt in 2 passes
- first pass is for orientation and a guess at the year
- 2nd pass is a flipped version if the first pass says it is upside-down
